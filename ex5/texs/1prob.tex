\subsection*{Problem 2}

Show that the sum of two independent random Gaussian variables $X_{1}$,
$X_{2}$ is a Gaussian. \\
We can define every Gaussian random variable $X\sim\mathcal{N}(u,\Sigma)$
using a linear transformation on 
\[
Z\sim\mathcal{N}(0,I)
\]
\[
X=\mu+LZ
\]
 where $L$ is defined by the Cholesky decomposition as 
 \[
 L=\Sigma L^{-T}
 \]
 Hence $X_{1}$and $X_{2}$ can be defined as

 \[
 X_{1}=\mu_{1}+L_{1}Z
 \]
 \[
 X_{2}=\mu_{2}+L_{2}Z
 \]
  if we now sum these two quantities we obtain a new random variable
      $X_{3}$ and we then obtain
      \[
      X_{3}=(\mu_{1}+\mu_{2})+(L_{1}+L_{2})Z
      \]
       $X_{3}$ is again a random variable with the following distribution
       $X_{3}\sim\mathcal{N}(\mu_{1}+\mu_{2},(L_{1}+L_{2})(L_{1}+L_{2})^{T})$.
